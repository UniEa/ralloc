/*
 ************class rpmalloc************
 * This is a persistent lock-free allocator based on LRMalloc.
 *
 * Function:
 * 		_init(string id, uint64_t thd_num):
 * 			Construct the singleton with id to decide where the data 
 * 			maps to. If the file exists, it tries to restart; otherwise,
 * 			it starts from scratch.
 * 		_close():
 * 			Shutdown the allocator by cleaning up free list 
 * 			and RegionManager pointer, but BaseMeta data will
 * 			preserve for remapping during restart.
 * 		T* _p_malloc<T>(size_t sz):
 * 			Malloc a block with size sz and type T.
 * 			Currently it only supports small allocation (<=MAX_SMALLSIZE).
 * 			If T is not void, sz will be ignored.
 * 		void _p_free(void* ptr):
 * 			Free the block pointed by ptr.
 * 		void* _set_root(void* ptr, uint64_t i):
 * 			Set i-th root to ptr, and return old i-th root if any.
 * 		void* _get_root(uint64_t i):
 * 			Return i-th root.
 * 		bool _collect(): TODO
 * 			Manually bring rpmalloc offline and do garbage collection
 * 
 * Note: Main data is stored in *base_md and is mapped to 
 * filepath, which is $(HEAPFILE_PREFIX)$(id).


 * It's from paper: 
 * 		LRMalloc: A Modern and Competitive Lock-Free Dynamic Memory Allocator
 * by 
 * 		Ricardo Leite and Ricardo Rocha
 *
 * p_malloc() and p_free() have large portion of code from the open source
 * project https://github.com/ricleite/lrmalloc.
 *
 * Adapted and reimplemented by:
 * 		Wentao Cai (wcai6@cs.rochester.edu)
